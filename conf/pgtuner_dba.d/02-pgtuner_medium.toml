# ======================== MEDIUM-PROFILE ========================
[pgtuner_dba.profile.medium]
# This profile is for medium instances, where workload is moderate. This profile assume that you have 2-8 CPU cores
# with 8-32 GiB of memory and 300 GiB of database storage (including data files, WAL, and indexes) per instance.
# This is the profile of most of the PostgreSQL instances. This profile uses the general-purpose ratio. The scope scale
# is similar to the multi-branch store.

# Memory is used to control the memory usage or database buffering of the database server.
memory_gib_min = 8
memory_gib_max = 32

# Logical CPU is used to control the concurrency of the database server.
cpu_core_min = 2
cpu_core_max = 8

# Storage is used to estimate the storage capacity of the database server for its sufficient workload
storage_gib_max = 300

# Network bandwidth. This bandwidth does not neccessary reflect this optimization context, but it is used to
# group the list of choices for the network bandwidth.
